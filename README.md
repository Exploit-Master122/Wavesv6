# Run Waves on Github Codespaces: (BEST VERSION!!!)

1. Create a GitHub account if you donâ€™t have one.If not,join the discord for links.Try the original one if it works.

2. Log in, click the green **"Code"** button, and select **"Codespaces"** on the right.

3. Click the **"+"** to create a new Codespace.

4. After everything loads, run these commands in the Linux terminal on the VS codespace.

```bash
npm i

npm start
```

5. When done, click **"Public"** on the pop-up and access your given URL.

6. Wait for the deployed github dev url to load.

7. Browse freely!!

8. When you want to use it again,you still have to load it through the terminal,otherwise,it won't work.

9. To make more links,in case the first github dev URL gets blocked,spam step 4.

10. Go to the "Ports" panel and right click one of the links.

11. Select Open in browser.

12. You did it! =-)
